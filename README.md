  - Integrates with the Hugging Face Hub for model loading.
  - Offers task-specific pipelines like `TextClassificationPipeline` and `QuestionAnsweringPipeline`.
- **Usage Example**: For text generation, the Pipeline can be used as follows:
  ```python
  from transformers import pipeline
  generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")
  output = generator("Hello, my name is", max_length=50, num_return_sequences=2)
  print(output)
  ```
  This example generates two sequences starting with "Hello, my name is," demonstrating the simplicity of the Pipeline for inference.

##### 2. Trainer Module
- **Description**: The Trainer module is a comprehensive API for training models, handling the training loop, evaluation, logging, and saving checkpoints. It supports advanced features like mixed precision training, distributed training across multiple GPUs or machines, and integration with the Hugging Face Hub for sharing models.
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic handling of training and evaluation loops, including logging and checkpoint saving.
  - Support for callbacks like `EarlyStoppingCallback` for optimizing training.
  - Integration with distributed training frameworks, enhancing scalability.
- **Usage Example**: Training a BERT model on the MRPC dataset for sequence classification:
  ```python
  from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer, BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
  from datasets import load_dataset

  dataset = load_dataset("glue", "mrpc")
  tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
  model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

  def tokenize_function(examples):
      return tokenizer(examples["sentence1"], examples["sentence2"], truncation=True, padding="max_length", max_length=128)

  tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)
  training_args = TrainingArguments(
      output_dir="./results",
      num_train_epochs=3,
      per_device_train_batch_size=16,
      per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
      warmup_steps=500,
      weight_decay=0.01,
      logging_dir="./logs",
      logging_steps=10,
      evaluation_strategy="steps",
      eval_steps=500,
      save_steps=500,
      load_best_model_at_end=True,
  )

  trainer = Trainer(
      model=model,
      args=training_args,
      train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"],
      eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets["validation"],
  )
  trainer.train()
  ```
  This example illustrates how the Trainer simplifies the training process, managing hyperparameters and evaluation automatically.

##### 3. Auto Classes Module
- **Description**: The Auto classes (`AutoModel`, `AutoTokenizer`, `AutoConfig`) enable flexible loading of pretrained models and their corresponding tokenizers and configurations without specifying the exact architecture. This is particularly useful when working with a variety of models from the Hugging Face Hub.
- **Key Classes**:
  - `AutoModel`: Loads the model architecture based on the model name.
  - `AutoTokenizer`: Loads the tokenizer corresponding to the model.
  - `AutoConfig`: Loads the configuration for the model, including hyperparameters.
- **Usage Example**: Loading a BERT model and tokenizer:
  ```python
  from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

  model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
  model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

  inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my name is Sarah", return_tensors="pt")
  outputs = model(**inputs)
  print(outputs.last_hidden_state)
  ```
  This example shows how Auto classes simplify model loading, making the library adaptable to different architectures.

##### 4. Model Classes Module
- **Description**: This module includes specific classes for each model architecture, such as `BertModel`, `GPT2Model`, `T5ForConditionalGeneration`, etc. Each class provides the implementation for a particular model and can be used for both inference and training, depending on the task.
- **Examples of Model Classes**:
  - `BertModel`: For BERT-based models, commonly used in text classification and question answering.
  - `GPT2Model`: For GPT-2 models, used in text generation tasks.
  - `T5ForConditionalGeneration`: For T5 models, suitable for translation and summarization.
- **Usage Example**: Using BertForSequenceClassification for inference:
  ```python
  from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification

  tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
  model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

  inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my name is Sarah", return_tensors="pt")
  outputs = model(**inputs)
  print(outputs.logits)
  ```
  This example demonstrates how to use a specific model class for a classification task.

##### 5. Tokenizers Module
- **Description**: The Tokenizers module is responsible for converting raw text into numerical representations (tokens) that can be processed by the models. Each model architecture has its own tokenizer class, such as `BertTokenizer` for BERT or `GPT2Tokenizer` for GPT-2, ensuring compatibility with the model’s preprocessing requirements.
- **Key Features**:
  - Tokenization: Splitting text into tokens, handling subword tokenization for out-of-vocabulary words.
  - Special tokens: Adding tokens like `[CLS]`, `[SEP]`, etc., for specific tasks like BERT.
  - Padding and truncation: Ensuring inputs are of uniform length for batch processing.
- **Usage Example**: Tokenizing input text for BERT:
  ```python
  from transformers import BertTokenizer

  tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
  inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my name is Sarah", return_tensors="pt")
  print(inputs)
  ```
  The output includes `input_ids`, `token_type_ids`, and `attention_mask`, showing the tokenized representation.

##### 6. Other Utility Modules
- **Description**: The library includes additional utility modules for specific tasks, enhancing flexibility and customization:
  - `TrainerCallback`: Allows customization of the training process, such as adding custom logging or early stopping.
  - `EarlyStoppingCallback`: Stops training when performance on a validation set stops improving.
  - `DataCollator`: Handles batch collation, ensuring data is properly formatted for training, such as padding sequences to the same length.
- **Usage Example**: Using a DataCollator for padding:
  ```python
  from transformers import DataCollatorWithPadding

  data_collator = DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer=tokenizer)
  ```
  This ensures batches are padded to the same length, facilitating efficient training.
